### Background for HW 5 - Part 2

Syracuse University is currently developing **[Six University-wide Shared Competencies](https://effectiveness.syr.edu/shared-competencies/)**

<br>

#### **From the website:**

"Undergraduate students develop competencies through their major degree courses, liberal arts requirements, and co-curricular experiences."

<br>

#### **Overall Goal of Shared Competencies:**

- Regardless of major, when students attain their undergraduate degree, they will be competent in these six essential area.
 
- This course, **BUA 455 - Data Management for Busines**, contributes to a student's compentency in **Information Literacy and Technology Agility (ILTA)**.

---

### BUA 455 - Information Literacy and Technology Agility


- Technology Agility skills are prevalent in every assignment and task throughout the course.

<br>

- Information literacy skills are primarily addressed in HW 5 - Part 2 and in the course project.

<br>

- Essential Information Literacy Skills include 

  - Knowing how to search for information and compare data sources.

  - Attributing data sources and software

  - Comparing and evaluating different options for presenting information to determine the right choice for a specific situation.

---

### Intro of HW 5 - Part 2
  
- This assignment expands the dashboard created in HW 5 - Part 1.

- For some tasks, you are adding plots that are redundant with previous ones

  - You will be asked to compare and contrast these data visualization options.

<br>
  
### Review and New Skills for HW 5 and Project
  
#### Adding a panel to a dashboard
  
- This is straightforward but it requires careful placement of the chunk, the panel header text, and the side panel text.

- In-class Demo

---

### Skills for HW 5 - Part 2 and Project

.pull-left[

### Adding linked text to Markdown Output
  
- This same format will work in Word, Powerpoint, Html, and Pdf output files

- Text to link goes in square brackets

### Skills for HW 5 - Part 2 and Project

#### Adding an image

- This same format will work in Word, Powerpoint, Html, and Pdf output files

- Similar to adding linked text:

  - Exclamation point followed by square brackets which can include a caption (optional)

  - Directly Followed by image file name in parentheses

  - Image file should be in `code_data_output` folder.

NOTE: You can save and export an R data visualization, and then place that figure elsewhere in the document as .png or .jpg file separate from R code.

### Skills for HW 5 - Part 2 and Project

#### Citing sources
  
- This is not an English class so I am not particular about citation formatting

- If you are publishing in a journal, you will be required to use that journal's format.

- If you are consulting for a client or for a company, defer to the citation format they prefer.

- In this course, all citations should be formatted **consistently**. Choose one format and stick with it.

- Here is link with suggestions on [how to cite websites](https://www.citationmachine.net/apa/cite-a-website)

#### Citing R

- Type `citation()` in the R Console to see the full citation which can be copy and pasted:


` citation() `

<br>

- To cite R:

R Core Team (2022). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL https://www.R-project.org/.
      
---
  
### Skills for HW 5 - Part 2 and Project

#### Citing R packages

- Type citation('package_name') in the R console.

- Replace `package_name` with name of package or package suite, e.g. `tidyverse` which is a suite of packages.


` citation('tidyverse') `

<br>

`tidyverse` suite include: 

`forcats`  `stringr`  `dplyr`   `purrr`   `readr`   
 
`tidyr`   `tibble`  `ggplot2`  `tidyverse`  

<br>

To cite `tidyverse`:

### Skills for HW 5 - Part 2 and Project

#### Citing RStudio

.pull-left[

- type `RStudio.Version()` in the R console


`RStudio.Version()`

#### Inline R code (Required for project, not HW 5 - Part 2)

- In your projects you are asked to include inline code in the text panels

- This is a good skill to know when managing and curating data in R

- It allows you to include R objects, variables, and calculations in text

- Inline R code will automatically update when data or R code are updated.

- To use inline code:

   **`1.`** Calculate and format values in an R chunk that can be hidden using `echo = F`
   
   **`2.`** Write text in your dashboard or report using inline chunk format.
   
- This 'micro-chunk' can include a saved value, a calculation, etc..  

- The 'micro-chunk' will not appear in your output document, and it will be replaced by the output value or calculation output you specify in the chunk.

---

### R Inline Code and Example

The small chunk that follows imports a dataset and does some of the data management tasks we have covered to a dataset about yearly movie gross.

In a dashboard or report, this chunk could be hidden by including `echo = F` in the chunk header.

```{r}

# import and manage data to keep top movies from each year
bom_yr <- read_csv("bom_yearly_top_gross_2022_11_07.csv", show_col_types = F, skip=11) |>
  filter(!is.na(Releases)) |>                              # remove rows with NAs
  slice(1:13) |>                                           # keep first 13 rows
  rename("yr"="Year", "tot_gross" = "Total Gross", "num1" = "#1 Release") |>
  select(yr, tot_gross, num1) |>
  mutate(yr = as.integer(yr),
         tot_gross = gsub("$", "", tot_gross, fixed = T),
         tot_gross = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", tot_gross, fixed = T))) 

# create variables for inline code
today <- Sys.Date()                                                # saves today's date
today_fmt <- stamp("Saturday, January 1, 1999", quiet = T)(today)  # formats date
# day_updated_fmt <- 

yr_to_date_gross <- round(bom_yr$tot_gross[1]/1000000000,2)        # formats & saves 1st gross
pct_of_prev <- round(bom_yr$tot_gross[1]/bom_yr$tot_gross[2]*100)  # creates formatted ratio 
pct_of_prev_more <- pct_of_prev - 100
# tenyr_pp_avg <- 
# pct_of_tenyr_pp_avg <- 

```

---
  
###  R Inline Code Example

.pull-left[

- In a polished document, the previous chunk could be hidden, by using the `echo=F` option in the chunk header.

- The document itself could have the following text which could be updated daily:

<br>

As of `r today_fmt`, the top grossing film of this year is *`r bom_yr$num1[1]`*.  

So far this year, the domestic total movie gross is `r yr_to_date_gross` billion dollars.  

This is already `r pct_of_prev_more`% more than last year's total domestic movie gross.


]

.pull-right[

![](docs_files/images/owl.png)

]
  

---

#### In-class Exercise

 
**`1.`** In the previous chunk: 

   - Create an additional formatted date value, `day_updated_fmt` to indicate when data were updated. Data were updated on 11/7/2022, `today - 1`.
   
   - Calculate average of total gross for the ten years before the pandemic (2010 - 2019) and save this value as an object, `tenyr_pp_avg`.
   
   - Calculate the ratio of the current gross for 2022 divided by the ten year average, format ratio as was done for `pct_of_prev`, and save this ratio as `pct_of_tenyr_pp_age`

**`2.`** Add more information to the text above, including two additional 'micro-chunks' of inline R code.  The full text section to be completed is shown below.

**`3.`** Knit your class notes (.Rmd) so that you have the final output as an html file and then save (print) it as a pdf and submit it.

  
As of `r today_fmt`, the top grossing film of this year is *`r bom_yr$num1[1]`*.     
So far this year, the domestic total movie gross is `r yr_to_date_gross` billion dollars.     
This total is already `r pct_of_prev_more`% more than last year's total domestic movie gross.   
It is `_____`% of the pre-pandemic ten-year average of domestic annual gross.     
These data were last updated on `_____` and can be [accessed at this link]().
